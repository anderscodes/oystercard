# Oystercard

Oystercard was our second weekly challenge that was set at Maker's Academy. We were instructed to emulate the oystercard network where you could touch in, touch out and be charged for your journey. 

This project was mainly an exercise in encapsulation and extraction as well as testing our ability to use mocking and doubling in the testing. As such we were instructed to build the entire program in one class and then begin to extract the functions out to different classes.

The extraction of the classes was quite challenging as it necessitated re-planning the domain model and of course a lot of modifying the existing tests.

As with all Maker's challenges the aim was not completion but learning and as such the project is not complete.
